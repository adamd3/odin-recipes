  <h3>Description</h3>
  I gotta admit it. I love slow cookers. This Slow-Cooker Breakfast Burrito has 
  a rich and savory flavor with a combination of ingredients that complement 
  each other. The slow-cooked eggs, seasoned sausage, and melted 
  cheese create a creamy and hearty base for the dish. The addition of bell 
  peppers, onions, and other vegetables provide a slightly sweet and crunchy 
  texture that adds depth to the overall taste. Perfect for a lazy weekend 
  morning or for meal prep throughout the week.
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds breakfast sausage</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 medium bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Cooking spray (olive oil is best)</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen shredded hash browns</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>12 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>12 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, 
        breaking it up with the back of a spoon, until lightly browned and 
        crumbly, about 8 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until onion 
        is softened, about 5 more minutes. Blot any excess oil in the pan with 
        a paper towel. Continue to cook until sausage is cooked completely, 5 
        to 7 more minutes. Remove from the heat. (This step can be done 1 day 
        ahead.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Spray slow cooker with cooking spray. Add sausage mixture, hash 
        browns, and Cheddar cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well 
        blended. Pour into the slow cooker and stir until evenly combined. 
        Cook on Low 6 to 8 hours or on High for 3 to 4 hours, stirring after 
        the first hour.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve mixture inside warmed tortillas with desired toppings.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Pro tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Use pre-seasoned breakfast sausage for best taste. 
        The herbier the better.
    </li>
    <li>
        Supplement with sliced bacon for extra decadence.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add spicy elements such as salsa or hot sauce for a zesty kick. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Oat milk or coconut milk are the best non-dairy options.
    </li>
  </ul>
