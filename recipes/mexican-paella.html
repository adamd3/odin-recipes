  <h3>Description</h3>
  A spicy take on the classic Spanish dish; this grain-free Mexican-style 
  version is packed with flavor and nutrients. Delicious served with a
  side of avocado and lime wedges. I like it extra spicy, so I add a sprinkle 
  of chilli flakes to the top before serving.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound chorizo sausage</li>
    <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cups cauliflower rice, divided</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 large yellow or orange bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon crushed saffron threads</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 cubes chicken bouillon</li>
    <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
    <li>3 frozen tilapia fillets</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Place a paella pan over medium-high heat. Add chorizo and cook, 
        stirring to break up any chunks, until browned and crumbly, about 5 
        minutes. Add chicken; cook and stir until no longer pink in the center 
        and the juices run clear. Transfer chicken and sausage to a plate, 
        leaving drippings in the pan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium and add 2 cups of cauliflower rice. Cook and 
        stir until cauliflower is browned slightly, about 5 minutes. Add onion, 
        bell pepper, salt, and pepper. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 
        about 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour canned tomatoes into the pan. Add bay leaves, thyme, saffron, and 
        basil; mix well. Return sausage and chicken back to the pan. Stir in 
        water, tomato paste, and bouillon until well combined. Bring to a boil, 
        then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the lid and fold in peas and remaining 1 cup cauliflower rice. 
        Place frozen tilapia fillets on top of paella mixture; cover and steam 
        for another 10 minutes. Remove the lid and check for doneness. Gently 
        break apart fillets with a wooden spoon and stir to incorporate chunks 
        of fish into paella.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional: add a sprinkle of chilli flakes to the top of the mixture,
        stir, and leave for an additional 2-3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the paella pan in the center of the table and serve.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Pro tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Cauliflower rice is generally expensive to buy. Make your own by simply 
        removing the leaves from a fresh head of cauliflower, chopping into 
        florets and pulsing in a food processor until it resembles rice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cooking the cauliflower rice in the sausage drippings will help it form 
        a nice toasty crust. This is very similar to the best part of 
        traditional paella with rice, where seared rice sticks to the bottom of 
        the pan.
