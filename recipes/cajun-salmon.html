  <h3>Description</h3>
  This Cajun Air-Fryer salmon is simple to make but packs a punch. The Cajun  
  seasoning, featuring a mix of paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne 
  pepper, and thyme, imparts a smoky, earthy, and slightly sweet taste to 
  the salmon. The Air-Fryer method also creates a crispy crust on the outside, 
  adding a pleasing crunch to the dish. The tender and flaky texture of the 
  salmon, along with its bold and spicy flavor, makes it a perfect pairing 
  with a side of roasted vegetables or a fresh salad. This dish is sure to 
  satisfy your taste buds with its delicious blend of Cajun flavors.
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooking oil spray</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the air 
        fryer basket with cooking oil spray.
    </li>
    <li>

        combined; spread onto a plate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rinse and dry salmon fillets with a paper towel. Mist fillets with 
        cooking spray. Press fillets, flesh-side down, into seasoning mixture. 
        Place coated fillets, skin-side down, into the prepared air fryer 
        basket. Mist fillets again with cooking spray.
    </li>
    <li>
        Close the lid and cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 minutes. Remove 
        from the air fryer and let rest for 2 minutes before serving.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Pro tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Use olive oil for best results. Olive oil has a high smoke point.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of the salmon. 
        The internal temperature should be ~145 degrees F (~63 degrees C).
